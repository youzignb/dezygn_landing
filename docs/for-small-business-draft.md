## Pain Points → Solutions

### "I can't afford a full-time designer"

Awa works for a fraction of the cost. Generate unlimited professional visuals for your products, social media, and marketing—without the $60k salary or unreliable freelancers.

*"I used to spend $500/month on a designer. Now I create better content myself in minutes."*

### "I don't know design terminology"

You don't need to. Just describe what you want like you're texting a friend:

- "Make my product look premium on a marble background"
- "Create an Instagram post announcing our summer sale"
- "Something warm and inviting for my bakery's website"

Awa understands your intent and translates it into professional results.

No more "does this match our brand?" moments.
