CASE STUDIES OF WORK I DID

PROJECT 1: Large Ecom Store

Goal: to reproduce accurate representation of chains and pendants in a lifestyle photography settings. Challenge: working with the company's styllist, photographer to create on-brand model and clothe styling. Also reproducing 2 to 6mm high pendants and 40 to 80cm chain proved to be very challenging with AI. Solution: this project required a lot of upfront R&D to custom create models, outfits, and finding the right wording to accurately represent tiny pendants and chains. It also required accurately measuring the products within the AI photography.

PROJECT 2: DANISH TOY BRAND

Goal: to create on-brand, premium AI photography to showcase children interacting with the brand's flagship product in a typical Danish interior setting. Problem: existing imagery were not on brand; a custom photoshoot would have been too expensive. Solution: I studied Danish interior design, flooring, furniture style, architecture, vegetation. Also Danish clothing brands. Based on this I was able to create accurate on-brand environments. The bigger challenge was to get a unique, foreign-to-LLMs product show in the right dimensions, this was done using my in-house image transfer technique.
