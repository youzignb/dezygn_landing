# Module 1: The Foundation (Production Script)

**Goal:** Transform the student from "AI hobbyist" to "Commercial AI Photographer." **Outcome:** Student understands the value gap ($25 vs $175) and learns the "Visual Syntax" as a diagnostic tool.

## Lesson 1.1: The Opportunity (Why We Are Here)

### Slide 1: The Value Switch

- **Visual:** Split Screen.
    
    - _Left Side:_ "Old Way: $2,000 Invoice (14 Days Turnaround)"
        
    - _Right Side:_ "New Way: $500 Invoice (24 Hours Turnaround)"
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "Traditional product photography is a logistical nightmare. Shipping products, hiring models, renting studios. We aren't just selling images; we are selling logistics and speed. You are the solution to their headache."
    

### Slide 2: The Two Products

- **Visual:** Simple icons or text cards.
    
    1. **Product Shot:** (Image of a clean bottle on white background). Label: _Perfect Truth_.
        
    2. **Lifestyle Shot:** (Image of that bottle in a sunlit bathroom). Label: _Desire_.
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "We only sell two things. The 'Amazon Listing' shot—which is pure truth—and the 'Instagram Ad' shot—which is pure desire. Most clients have the truth; they are desperate for the desire."
    

### Slide 3: The Goal: Subliming

- **Visual:** Side-by-Side comparison.
    
    - _Image A:_ A boring phone photo of a watch on a desk.
        
    - _Image B:_ Your Dezygn version of the same watch on a granite slab with moody lighting.
        
    - _Text Overlay:_ "Subliming."
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "Our job is 'Subliming.' We take a boring object and make it look expensive through context and light. This is why you get paid."
    

## Lesson 1.2: The "Good Enough" Trap (The 80% vs 99% Rule)

### Slide 4: The Client's Problem

- **Visual:** Screenshot of a generic Midjourney discord chat.
    
    - _Text:_ "Clients are already trying this themselves."
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "Your clients aren't stupid. They have ChatGPT. They have Midjourney. But they are failing."
    

### Slide 5: The 80% Reality

- **Visual:** A 'Fail' Image.
    
    - _Image:_ A model wearing a necklace where the pendant is clearly huge and the chain is wrong.
        
    - _Text Overlay:_ "80% Vibes / 20% Fail."
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "Standard AI gets the 'vibe' right—that's the 80%. But it fails the product specs. A 'small pendant' becomes a medallion. 'Navy blue' becomes 'Royal blue'."
    

### Slide 6: The Consequence

- **Visual:** A mock 1-star review.
    
    - _Text:_ "Item not as pictured! Returned."
        
    - _Equation:_ 80% Accuracy = 100% Refund Request.
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "In commerce, 'close enough' is a refund. If the color is wrong, they lose money. This is why they can't use Midjourney alone."
    

### Slide 7: Your Job

- **Visual:** A bridge graphic.
    
    - _Left Cliff:_ "80% (AI Tools)"
        
    - _Right Cliff:_ "99% (Commercial Ready)"
        
    - _The Bridge:_ "YOU (The Dezygn Methodology)"
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "You are not paid to generate images. You are paid to bridge this gap. You are the quality control that ensures dimensions, materials, and lighting are real."
    

## Lesson 1.3: The Visual Syntax (Your Diagnostic Tool)

### Slide 8: The Formula

- **Visual:** Large, bold text centered on screen.
    
    - `Image = Visual Syntax`
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "Stop guessing. Stop treating the prompt box like a slot machine. From today, we treat images as a formula."
    

### Slide 9: Layers 1 & 2 (The Base)

- **Visual:**
    
    1. **[DESIGN TYPE]:** Photo vs Vector vs 3D.
        
    2. **[SUBJECT]:** The Hero Object.
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "First, what are we making? If you don't tell the AI it's a 'Photo,' it might give you a painting. Second, who is the hero?"
    

### Slide 10: Layers 3 & 4 (The Mood)

- **Visual:** 3. **[VISUAL CHARACTER]:** Mood, Action, Lighting. 4. **[CONTEXT]:** Environment.
    
- **Script/Talking Points:** "This is the vibe. Context dictates light. If your context is a sunset, your subject _must_ be orange. If you miss this, the image looks fake."
    

### Slide 11: Layers 5 & 6 (The Polish)

- **Visual:** 5. **[TECHNICAL]:** Camera, Lens (Macro/Wide), Film. 6. **[STYLE/REFERENCE]:** Aesthetic (Vogue, Cyberpunk).
    
- **Script/Talking Points:** "Technical details change the physics of the image. A macro lens makes small things look huge. This is how we control scale."
    

### Slide 12: The Takeaway

- **Visual:** A photo with the 6 labels pointing to different parts of it.
    
- **Script/Talking Points:** "Your homework: When you look at an ad, don't just say 'nice.' Deconstruct it. Find the 6 layers."
    

## Lesson 1.4: The 6 Slots (Interchangeability)

### Slide 13: The 6 Slots

- **Visual:** 6 Empty Boxes in a row.
    
    - Labels: `[TYPE]` `[HERO]` `[ACTION]` `[PLACE]` `[CAMERA]` `[STYLE]`
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "An image is not magic. It is just six empty slots. To make an image, you must fill all six slots. That is the only rule."
    

### Slide 14: The Toggle Switch

- **Visual:** One Box zoomed in (e.g., [HERO]).
    
    - Beneath it, a Toggle Switch.
        
    - Left position: **TYPE IT** (Keyboard Icon).
        
    - Right position: **UPLOAD IT** (File Icon).
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "But here is the secret. You don't have to write everything. For every single slot, you have a choice: You can Type it, or you can Upload it."
    

### Slide 15: Swapping Blocks (The Example)

- **Visual:** The 6 Slots again.
    
    - **[HERO] Slot:** Shows a Photo of a Shoe (Uploaded).
        
    - **[PLACE] Slot:** Shows text "On the Moon" (Typed).
        
    - **[STYLE] Slot:** Shows a Photo of a Vogue Cover (Uploaded).
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "This is how pros work. I don't describe the shoe—I upload the shoe. I don't describe the style—I upload the style. I only type the location. The AI mixes them for me."
    

### Slide 16: The "Paint Over" Rule (Enhancement)

- **Visual:**
    
    - Step 1: Upload Photo of Woman.
        
    - Step 2: A Hand "Painting" over her lips with red paint.
        
    - Text: `Upload + "Red Lipstick"`
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "And finally: You can cheat. You can upload a photo of a woman, and then use text to 'paint' red lipstick on her. You can combine Upload + Type in the same slot."
    

## Lesson 1.5: The Reality of Volume (Managing Expectations)

### Slide 17: Myth vs Reality

- **Visual:**
    
    - _Top:_ "The Myth: 1 Prompt = 1 Perfect Image."
        
    - _Bottom:_ "The Reality: 1 Perfect Image = 50 Generations."
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "If you think you'll get it in one click, you will quit. Real photographers take 500 shots for one cover. We generate 50 to get one hero."
    

### Slide 18: Mining for Gold

- **Visual:** Icon of a Gold Miner panning for gold.
    
- **Script/Talking Points:** "This process is R&D. You are mining. 49 images will be trash so that the 50th one can make you $50."
    

### Slide 19: Closing Hook

- **Visual:** Teaser text.
    
    - "Coming Up: Module 2 - The 'Fixer' Workflow."
        
    - "Turning Trash into Gold."
        
- **Script/Talking Points:** "Now that you speak the language, let's use it. In the next module, we take a bad client photo and turn it into gold using the 'Fixer' workflow."

## Module 2: The Prep Work (The "Pro" Difference)

**Goal:** Stop the student from jumping straight into generating. Teach them that 80% of success happens _before_ the first prompt. **Outcome:** Student knows how to break down a brief and prepare assets so they don't waste credits on bad inputs.

### Lesson 2.1: The Brief Deconstruction

- **Concept:** Client emails are messy. Your job is to translate "Make it pop" into Syntax.
    
- **Action:** Taking a messy email and filling out the 6 Syntax Slots.
    
- **Tool:** The "Brief-to-Syntax" Worksheet.
    

### Lesson 2.2: Asset Hygiene (Garbage In, Garbage Out)

- **Concept:** You cannot make a luxury image from a low-res, blurry product shot.
    
- **Checklist:**
    
    1. **Isolation:** Is the product cut out perfectly? (Removing backgrounds).
        
    2. **Resolution:** Is it at least 2k? (Upscaling basics).
        
    3. **Lighting Match:** Does the product have hard shadows that will clash with a soft background?
        

### Lesson 2.3: The Measurement Protocol (Crucial)

- **Concept:** The #1 reason for returns is size. You must know the physical reality of the object.
    
- **The Workflow:**
    
    - Ask Client for dimensions.
        
    - **The Nano Banana Hack:** Using the "Product Length Measurement" System Prompt (from your notes) to verify visual scale.
        
    - _Why:_ "If you prompt 'perfume on rock' without knowing the size, the rock might look like a mountain."
        

## Module 3: The Money Workflows (Execution)

**Goal:** The repeatable recipes. These are the "products" the student will sell. **Outcome:** Student masters the 3 core commercial workflows.

### Lesson 3.1: Workflow A - The Fixer (Lifestyle Ref → Lifestyle Shot)

- **Scenario:** Client sends a bad photo from their iPhone. "We like the pose, but the background is messy."
    
- **The Method:**
    
    - **Input:** The Bad Photo (Anchor).
        
    - **Syntax:** Keep [HERO] and [ACTION]. Change [PLACE] and [STYLE].
        
    - **Prompting:** Describing only the new background while locking the composition.
        
- **Best For:** Complex products (like the "Hippo" or "Tumler") where recreating the product from scratch is impossible.
    

### Lesson 3.2: Workflow B - The Builder (Product Ref → Lifestyle Shot)

- **Scenario:** Client sends a clean white-background product shot. "Put this in a luxury bathroom."
    
- **The Method:**
    
    - **Input:** The Product Shot (Anchor).
        
    - **Syntax:** [HERO] is fixed. Everything else is Prompted (Text).
        
    - **The Challenge:** Scale and Shadow. Making the product "sit" in the world, not float above it.
        
- **Best For:** Standard CPG products (Skincare, Bottles, Boxes).
    

### Lesson 3.3: Workflow C - The Architect (Text2Img Ref + Product Ref)

- **Scenario:** The _Trendhim_ Example. "We need a very specific, intricate environment that doesn't exist."
    
- **The Method:**
    
    - **Step 1:** Text-to-Image Generation (Create the empty background/world first).
        
    - **Step 2:** Image-to-Image (Composite the product into that pre-made world).
        
- **Best For:** High-concept campaigns. Fantasy environments. Specific props.
    

## Module 4: The Business (Making It Real)

**Goal:** Turning skills into invoices. **Outcome:** Student has a pricing model and a delivery system.

### Lesson 4.1: The Delivery Pipeline (The Last 1%)

- **Concept:** An AI generation is not a deliverable. It is a "Raw File."
    
- **The Polish Steps:**
    
    1. **Upscaling:** Going from 1k to 4k/8k without breaking details.
        
    2. **Photoshop Touch:** Fixing weird text, smoothing skin, color grading.
        
    3. **The "Squint Test":** Does it look real at a glance?
        

### Lesson 4.2: Pricing Your Service

- **Concept:** Stop charging hourly. Charge by the asset.
    
- **The Model:**
    
    - **Tier 1:** "The Fix" ($25/img) - Fixing their bad photos.
        
    - **Tier 2:** "The Creation" ($50-$75/img) - Building new worlds.
        
    - **The Bulk Deal:** "10 Images for $400" (Encourages volume).
        

### Lesson 4.3: Getting Your First Client

- **Strategy:** "The Free Fix."
    
- **Action:**
    
    1. Find a brand with bad ads on Instagram/Etsy.
        
    2. Steal their product image.
        
    3. Run "Workflow A" (The Fixer).
        
    4. DM them the result: "I saw your ad and thought this might convert better. Yours for free."
        
- **Why:** Results in advance = Instant trust.
