FEATURES
What’s new with Dezygn 4.5? Everything. 

(Dev note: here let’s insert the relevant updates/shortcuts/video-clips and images. Im thinking an alternate two column layout (one time text left, image right, other time text right image left) with the text for each feature on the left and the video clip looping without controls in the right. And below it, when available, a gallery of the ui screenshots I included in the images folder. I will note the name of each file below. _

Better Designs
Your products deserve perfection. No more distorted bags, warped logos, or uncanny models. Every angle, every detail, every pixel — exactly as it should be. From a single product photo, create unlimited lifestyle shots that look like you hired a photography studio. Except you didn't. You just clicked once.

Better Prompt Adherence
Say exactly what you want. Get exactly what you meant. No more AI guessing games or creative interpretations you didn't ask for. When you say "red dress, blue background, holding my product," that's precisely what appears. Your vision, realized instantly. Every single time.better-text.mp4
images: better-prompt-adherence folder

Better Image Editing
Change your mind without starting over. See something that needs tweaking? Just tell Dezygn. "Make the background warmer." Done. "Add our logo to the corner." There it is. Edit with words, not tools. It's like having a designer who reads your mind — and never gets tired.

Better Text Fidelity
Your words matter. Every letter, every line, perfectly rendered. Where others stumble at three words, Dezygn handles sixty. Create infographics that inform. Headers that command attention. Call-to-actions that actually work. Because typos don't convert. Precision does.

Recipes: The End of Prompt Paralysis
Stop staring at blank screens. Start creating instantly. Professional designers know the thousand little decisions that make great design — now you do too. Choose a recipe. Customize it. Ship it. From book covers to product shots, we've encoded decades of design expertise into simple, guided workflows. You're not learning to design. You're designing.

Collage: Unlocking Possibilities
One model. Five products. Infinite combinations. Upload your entire collection and watch Dezygn orchestrate the perfect scene. Your model wearing your jeans, holding your bag, showcasing your sunglasses — all in one coherent, beautiful image. It's not composite work. It's compositional magic.

Templates: Changing the Game
Start with winners. We analyzed thousands of high-converting Facebook ads from billion-dollar brands. Their proven formulas, now yours. Swap their products for yours. Their models for yours. Their success for yours. Why guess what works when you can know?

Variations: Quickly Iterate

Ingredients Panel: Speeding Up Your Workflow
Your creative assets, always at hand. No more hunting through folders or scrolling through uploads. Everything you need lives in a smart sidebar that knows what you're working on. Drag, drop, create. Repeat at the speed of thought.

Smaller Updates That Make Everything Better
Generate five designs while your coffee brews — simultaneously. Upload entire folders at once. Import from URLs instantly. Watch images appear progressively, not painfully. These aren't features. They're time you get back. Minutes saved become hours earned become days reclaimed.


Video Studio: The Future Arrives Early
Ten seconds to video. Not rendering time — total time. Test ideas at the speed of thought with Fast Gen. Create Hollywood-quality scenes with Veo 3. Build episodic content with scene continuity. Video creation that once required a studio now requires a sentence. The playing field hasn't just leveled. It's disappeared.
